The LSB Image Steganography Project revolves around the fascinating art of concealing communication by embedding secret information within other seemingly ordinary data. Among the various carrier file formats available, digital images are the most popular due to their ubiquity on the internet. Steganography techniques for hiding information in images vary widely in complexity, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses. While some applications prioritize complete invisibility of the hidden information, others focus on the capacity to embed larger messages.

Steganography is often confused with cryptography, as both are methods to safeguard sensitive information. However, the two differ significantlyâ€”while cryptography encrypts data to make it unreadable without a key, steganography conceals the very existence of the data, making it appear as though no hidden information is present. This deceptive invisibility leverages human perception, as people are generally untrained to detect files with embedded information. Specialized software exists to uncover steganographic content, but the practice remains a subtle and effective method for discreet data hiding. The most common use of steganography is to embed one file within another, such as hiding a text file inside an image.

The project implements these principles using an application that accepts an image file, such as a .bmp, along with a text file containing the message to be hidden. It analyzes the size of the text file to ensure the message can fit within the provided image. Additionally, the application includes the option to embed a "magic string," which can help identify whether an image has been steganographically modified. Users can also decrypt the hidden message from the image. This command-line application operates entirely via command-line arguments, providing a practical and efficient tool for experimenting with steganography techniques.
